# US Census Data Analysis

### Project Overview 
This project includes data from all counties' US census in 2015, available in Kaggle. Tableau Public was used to get some interactive visualizations in order to answer 3 main questions:
In which states do people have the best transportation?
How does poverty look in the US and what is the correlation between unemployment and poverty for each state? 
Which states have the highest income per capita in the US?
